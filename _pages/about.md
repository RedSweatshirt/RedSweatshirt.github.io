Fourth year B.S. Computer Science and Engineering student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'm interested in computational design, computer graphics, and vision and would love to talk more about my skills and experiences. I have experience with Python, Java, C++, C#, DirectX, OpenGL, Arduino, and Unity.
