#### Welcome to my portfolio page

Hi, I'm Jack! I hold both a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science (S.B.) in Computer Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I completed my M.Eng. in 2024, with a focus on Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence, following my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic journey has been a deep dive into computational design, computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. In this space, I’m excited to share my journey and the projects I've worked on.

#### My Interests

Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by video games and the technology behind creating them. This interest led me to explore computer science and graphics, where I discovered the processes that bring virtual worlds to life. I then also became captivated by computer vision, which opened up possibilities for creating systems that perceive and interpret the world.

In my free time, I enjoy working on writing shaders in HLSL for Unity, allowing me to explore creative possibilities and expand my technical knowledge. I also enjoy designing and coding small electronics projects, which has helped me develop skills in embedded systems and hardware design.

#### My Skills

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained extensive experience in various programming languages and frameworks, including Python, PyTorch, C++, C#, HLSL, DirectX, OpenGL, Arduino, and Unity. I've developed physics simulations for underwater gliders at MIT CSAIL, worked on GPU driver modifications at Intel Corporation, and created web applications for mental health support with MIT's MindHandHeart initiative. For more details about my experiences, please see my [resume](\cv\).

In addition to technical skills, I earned a minor in Japanese during my undergraduate studies at MIT, broadening my cultural perspective alongside my technical work.

#### My Projects

I invite you to explore my [portfolio](/projects/) further to learn more about the diverse range of projects I've been involved in. From developing accelerated physics simulation algorithms utilizing mesh decimation to designing open-source embedded systems for remote monitoring of mouse feeders at MIT Choi Labs, I have tackled a wide variety of challenges and grown my skills through hands-on experience.

#### Let's Connect

I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with others who share my passion for technology and innovation. If you’d like to discuss my skills, experiences, or potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out.
