#### Welcome to Jack's portfolio page

Hi, I'm Jack!  I'm currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I also earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. Passionate about computational design, computer graphics, and computer vision, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills and apply my knowledge through various academic and industry experiences. In this space, I would like to share more about my journey and the projects I've worked on.

#### My Interests

Since I was young, I've always had a fascination with video games and how they are created. This interest led me to explore the world of computer graphics, where I discovered the intricate processes and technologies that bring virtual worlds to life. Over time, I became captivated by computer vision as well, which opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for creating intelligent systems that can perceive and interpret the world around them.

In my free time, I enjoy designing and coding small electronics projects, which has allowed me to further develop my skills in embedded systems and hardware design. These creative outlets let me explore new possibilities while expanding my technical knowledge.

#### My Skills

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained extensive experience in various programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, C#, DirectX, OpenGL, Arduino, and Unity. I've had the chance to work on cutting-edge research projects at MIT, develop GPU driver modifications at Intel Corporation, and create web applications for mental health support in collaboration with MIT's MindHandHeart initiative.

In addition to my technical skills, I studied Japanese language and history in the classroom for 3 years and have earned a minor in the language during my time at MIT. This has allowed me to broaden my cultural horizons to complement my technical studies.

#### My Projects

I invite you to explore my portfolio further to learn more about the diverse range of projects I've been involved in. From developing physics simulations for underwater gliders at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to designing embedded systems for remote monitoring of mouse feeders at MIT Choi Labs, I have tackled a wide variety of challenges and made significant contributions to various fields.

#### Let's Connect

I am always eager to learn and collaborate with others who share my passion for technology and innovation. If you would like to discuss my skills, experiences, or any potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me. Together, we can create cutting-edge solutions that shape the future.
